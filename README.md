# Introducing the melding of decentralized currency with the legacy decentralized email system.

## Problem:

We are all overrun with marketing emails. They have become a drain on our time, on the internet infrastructure itself and as a result are a huge cost on the economy. Spam emails make up 70% of all email sent on the internet today, a volume that despite laws and regulations hasnâ€™t stopped growing.  Yet direct email marketing is still the most effective channel through which businesses are able to reach customers, re-engage them and drive sales. With the constant barrage of emails many of us simply turn up the spam filters, declare inbox bankruptcy and mass delete emails.

## Solution:

The solution is to provide some incentive to both the marketers and to the email recipients to account for the time it takes to open and read an email. A fee paid for by the marketers that is transferred to the wallets of those whose attention you wish to get. As a result marketers gain increased engagement on their emails, and recipients get valuable tokens.

KM Token serves as the decentralized currency to compensate users and the KoinMail platform ensures that any emails delivered through it result in transactions on behalf of the recipient.
